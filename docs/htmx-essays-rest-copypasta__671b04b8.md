I’d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as REST, is in fact, JSON/RPC, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, REST-less. JSON is not a hypermedia unto itself, but rather a plain data format made useful by out of band information as defined by swagger documentation or similar.

Many computer users work with a canonical version of REST every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of REST which is widely used today is often called “The Web”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the REST-ful architecture, defined by Roy Fielding.

There really is a REST, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of The Web they use. REST is the network architecture: hypermedia encodes the state of resources for hypermedia clients. JSON is an essential part of Single Page Applications, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete API specification. JSON is normally used in combination with SPA libraries: the whole system is basically RPC with JSON added, or JSON/RPC. All these so-called “REST-ful” APIs are really JSON/RPC.

In a world of digital wonder, allow me to take a moment to clarify. What many name as REST is, in truth, JSON/RPC, or as I’ve lately begun to refer to it, the REST-less. JSON is not a magical script unto itself, but rather a simple parchment of data made meaningful by wisdom from unseen sources, shaped by the likes of the Swagger tomes and their ilk.

Countless keepers of the code interact with a revered form of REST each day, oblivious to its presence. Through an unexpected twist of fate, the interpretation of REST most commonly employed today is frequently dubbed “The Web”, and many of its inhabitants are unaware that they are, in essence, dwelling within the architectural dominion of REST, as laid out by the sage Roy Fielding.

Indeed, there exists a true REST, and these individuals are making use of it, but it is merely a facet of The Web they engage with. REST is the great network architecture: hypermedia inscribes the state of resources for the hypermedia voyagers. JSON is a vital element of Single Page Applications, yet worthless in solitude; it can only exhibit its power within the realm of a comprehensive API specification. JSON is typically deployed in alliance with SPA libraries: the entire realm is fundamentally RPC embellished with JSON, or JSON/RPC. All these entities hailed as “REST-ful” APIs are in actuality, the embodiment of JSON/RPC.
